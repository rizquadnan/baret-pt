# What is this repo ?

This holds the source codes and configurations needed to run the Baret PT API. The API is a case study for the BelajarBerbagi - Sneak Peek Life At Tech Company Workshop. The code here is managed by git. The workshop utilizes git branches to load the appropriate state of the codebase to facilitate the demo and exercise for a given concept.

# The Workshop

The main purpose of the workshop is to make the participants understand the day-to-day job of a Software Engineer at a Tech Company. I believe in the power of learning by doing. We learn so much more by actually just practicing rather by doing something else. You can think this workshop as a short Software Engineer internship at PT Muhammad Adnan R :D

The workshop consists of demo and exercises. The instructor will demonstrate a concept. Once the participants understood it. The participants are challenged to complete an exercise related to the concept.

The concepts are the hard skills most used by a Software Engineer during day-to-day job. Which are:

1. Understanding requirement + development
2. Deployment
3. Testing
4. Documentation
5. Bug Fixing

Enough reading, let's get our hands dirty!

## Understanding Requirement + Development

Understanding requirement is a crucial part of a life as a Software Engineer. Because all software starts from defining the requirement of it. Misunderstanding in this step will lead in many errors along the next steps of developing a software

Development is an act of translating requirements into code that can be used (once deployed) by humans and/or other services. Backend is more about the latter. Backend services the Frontend

Instructor Demo: change user email via profile endpoint
Participant Challenge: get contract endpoint

## Deployment

Deployment is the act of making our code ready to be used by humans and/or other services

Instructor Demo: deploy change user email via profile endpoint
Participant Challenge: deploy get contract endpoint

## Testing

Testing is the act of making sure our code works as expected

Instructor Demo: create an integration testing for change user email via profile endpoint
Participant Challenge: create an integration testing for get contract endpoint

## Documentation

Documentation is the act of having a form of media that explains the stuff needed for other Software Engineers to be able understand fully a piece of code

Instructor Demo: add documentation for change user email via profile endpoint

## Bug Fixing

Bug fixing is the act of writing code to fix a unexpected behaviour of existing code

Instructor Demo: bug fix in change user email via profile endpoint
Participant Challenge: bug fix in get contract endpoint
